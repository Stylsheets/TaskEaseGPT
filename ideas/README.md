# Features/Ideas
## Asynchronous AI Interactions

To enhance efficiency, master AI can interact with other AI systems asynchronously. This allows the master AI to proceed with other tasks while waiting for responses from the secondary AI systems.

## Task Management System

The core concept of this project is a comprehensive task management system. It will handle tasks in the form of a to-do list and potentially through programmatic methods. Initially, the AI will generate a task list to accomplish a specific goal. Subsequently, it will execute and track the progress of each task, marking them as complete or failed. A more advanced implementation could involve using a queue system for task management.

## Task Failure and Timeouts

TaskEaseGPT may sometimes encounter loops or reach an impasse. In such cases, a secondary AI can provide feedback to identify the issue. Alternatively, each task can have a predefined time limit, set by the AI during task creation. If the limit is exceeded, the task will be paused, prompting the user to decide whether to continue, restart, or attempt recovery.

## Web Access for Information Retrieval

The AI can leverage web search capabilities to answer queries. It will first generate a Google search query and receive search results consisting of website ranks, titles, descriptions, and URLs. The AI will then select a website to extract information from and formulate a question to find the desired answer. A scraper instance will enter the website, divide the text into chunks, and use the "Refine" method from LangChain to summarize the text.

> Refine: This method involves running an initial prompt on the first chunk of data, generating some output. For the remaining documents, that output is passed in, along with the next document, asking the LLM to refine the output based on the new document.

## Long-Term Memory through Vector Database

A vector database, such as Pinecone, is employed to store all AI-generated outputs. Before each AI request, the prompt is passed to the vector database to retrieve relevant "memories." The most pertinent memories are then included with the prompt, as long as the token limit is not exceeded. This feature functions as a long-term memory for the AI system.

## Multiple Masters with a Coordinator

We can allow multiple master AIs to run while a coordinator will manage them as needed.
